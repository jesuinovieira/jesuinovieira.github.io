<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am broadly interested in <b>deep learning</b> and <b>AI for scientific discovery</b>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In particular, I am drawn to <b>representation learning</b>, <b>graph neural networks</b>, <b>generative models</b>, and <b>reinforcement learning</b>. I am motivated by research that leverages these methods to tackle real-world challenges, such as accelerating drug discovery, addressing climate-related problems, and advancing our understanding of the brain.

Prior to my current studies, I spent over five years as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://iconpro.com/en/">IconPro</a>, where I developed machine learning solutions for industrial applications. I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the <a href="https://en.ufsc.br/2020/03/20/mechatronics-engineering-joinville/">Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)</a>, where I gained early research experience in machine learning, working on computer vision and time series forecasting under the supervision of <a href="https://pajaskowiak.github.io/">Prof. Pablo A. Jaskowiak</a>.
